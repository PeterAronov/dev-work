"It seems like there was an issue retrieving the detailed information from the user profiles, as they are all showing as \"undefined.\" Without the specific details of each profile, it's challenging to determine which users truly match the query requirements for a software engineer with experience in AI and machine learning.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. **Check the Data Source**: Ensure that the profiles are correctly loaded and accessible. There might be a technical issue causing the details to appear as \"undefined.\"\n\n2. **Refine the Search**: Consider using more specific search terms or filters. For example, you might include specific programming languages, tools, or platforms related to AI and machine learning, such as Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.\n\n3. **Alternative Search Terms**: If the current search terms aren't yielding useful results, you might try variations like \"AI developer,\" \"machine learning specialist,\" or \"data scientist with AI expertise.\"\n\n4. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists, it might be helpful to contact technical support for assistance in resolving the data retrieval problem.\n\nOnce the profiles are accessible, you can then analyze them to determine which candidates best match your requirements. If you need further assistance with this process, feel free to ask!"
