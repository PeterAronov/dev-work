"Based on the search for a software engineer with experience in AI and machine learning, let's examine the user profiles to determine which ones best match the query requirements.\n\n1. **Dr. Kunal Sharma** (Similarity Score: 45%)\n   - **Location:** Berlin\n   - **Role:** Data Scientist\n   - **Skills:** Python, PyTorch, NLP, biomedical data modeling\n   - **Experience:** Focuses on machine learning for healthcare, with a PhD in AI from ETH Zurich. Previously worked with DeepMind and Novartis.\n   - **Relevance:** Kunal has a strong background in AI and machine learning, particularly in healthcare, which aligns well with the query requirements. However, his role is more aligned with data science than software engineering.\n\n2. **Dr. Elena Petrova** (Similarity Score: 45%)\n   - **Location:** Zurich, Switzerland\n   - **Role:** AI Research Scientist\n   - **Skills:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, fastai\n   - **Experience:** Holds a Ph.D. in Machine Learning, focused on transformer interpretability and multilingual embeddings. Leads a research group at NeuralX AI Labs, with collaborations with Hugging Face and DeepMind.\n   - **Relevance:** Elena has extensive experience in AI and machine learning, making her a strong match for the query. Her role as an AI research scientist is closely related to software engineering in AI contexts.\n\n3. **Lior Ben-David** (Similarity Score: 37%)\n   - **Location:** Tel Aviv\n   - **Role:** Quantitative Analyst\n   - **Skills:** R, Machine Learning, Monte Carlo, Python\n   - **Relevance:** Lior has experience in machine learning, but his primary role as a quantitative analyst may not fully align with the software engineering aspect of the query.\n\nThe best matches for the query are Dr. Elena Petrova and Dr. Kunal Sharma, with Dr. Elena Petrova being the most relevant due to her direct involvement in AI research and software development. Dr. Kunal Sharma also has a strong background in AI and machine learning but is more focused on data science.\n\nIf none of these profiles fully meet your requirements, you might consider searching with terms like \"AI software developer,\" \"machine learning engineer,\" or \"AI systems engineer\" to find more closely aligned candidates."
